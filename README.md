Oasis 

Problem Statement:
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining good mental health is challenging due to the daily pressures of life.
We struggle to manage their emotions and uplift their mood amidst these pressures.
Traditional methods of seeking help, like therapy or counseling have the issue of lack of accessible resources leaves many people feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and unable to regulate their emotions effectively.
